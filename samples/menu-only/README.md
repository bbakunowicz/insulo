# Menu only sample

This example shows the basic functionality of the menu component, without the authorization, location and theming functions.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with *npx create-react-app menu-only --template insulo*.

## Using this example:
```
git clone https://github.com/bbakunowicz/insulo.git
cd insulo/samples/menu-only
yarn install && yarn start
```
or
```
git clone https://github.com/bbakunowicz/insulo.git
cd insulo/samples/menu-only
yarn install && yarn build && serve -s build
```
