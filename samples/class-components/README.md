# Class Components Sample

This example shows the use of React class components instead of React functional components. All components in the *src/pages* directory were converted from functional components to class components, if it was not even necessary.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with *npx create-react-app class-components --template insulo*. 

## Using this example:
```
git clone https://github.com/bbakunowicz/insulo.git
cd insulo/samples/class-components
yarn install && yarn start
```
or
```
git clone https://github.com/bbakunowicz/insulo.git
cd insulo/samples/class-components
yarn install && yarn build && serve -s build
```
