# cra-template-insulo-full

This is the official full template for [InsuloJS components](https://github.com/bbakunowicz/insulo). An application created with this template includes full functionality of insulo components.

InsuloJS components are a collection of components designed to rapidly build [React-based](https://reactjs.org/) applications. InsuloJS components are based on the [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) library. They use [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), in terms of state management. 

More information can be found on the [InsuloJS project](https://github.com/bbakunowicz/insulo) website. Basic examples can also be found on the website of the [insulo-route](https://www.npmjs.com/package/insulo-route) package or on the website of the [insulo-menu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/insulo-menu) package.
